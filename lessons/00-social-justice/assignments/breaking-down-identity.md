# Assignment: Breaking Down Identity

Our identities are complicated. We carry with us many different affinities, including race, sexuality, ethnicity, religion, and class, just to name a few. Some parts of ourselves may garner privilege, while others may be culturally marginalized.  We can use the term “intersectionality” to refer to this understanding of multiplicity.
